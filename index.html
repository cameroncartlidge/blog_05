The article brings up how drones are better for sports perspectives, less risk of wildlife photography, and give a unique perspective of any form of photography. The article also says how real estate is affected by drone photography as well. speaking from a personal experience as I myself have used drones for real estate photography, having a drone makes it very easy to get outside perspectives of a home as well as showing the close proximity of the home.  </p>

            <p> This article talks about how wearing a VR headset takes complete control of your senses primarily, seeings and hearing, but in the near future technology is heading into a direction where VR headsets will most likely be able to have feel as well as smell embeded into the games or when you put on a headset. VR headsets are used for many training programs some such as space exploration, Hostage situations, and gun control. VR headsets are heading into a direction where you might not even need to leave your room for the whole day and still experience the outside world through the headset. </p>

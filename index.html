The article meantions that the original airpods were made very good and comfy and were the first of their kind but the battery lifespan on the originals were not good and after about a month of owning them they would die within 30 minutes of use time. The article meantions after that that the 2nd generation airpods are much better and have a better more extended battery life and are more comfy / easier on the ears.   </p>

        <p> The article talks about how drones have changed the face of photography and how photography might shift into a primarily drone scene. The article brings up how drones are better for sports perspectives, less risk of wildlife photography, and give a unique perspective of any form of photography. The article also says how real estate is affected by drone photography as well. speaking from a personal experience as I myself have used drones for real estate photography, having a drone makes it very easy to get outside perspectives of a home as well as showing the close proximity of the home.  </p>
